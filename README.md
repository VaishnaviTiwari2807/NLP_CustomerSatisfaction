# NLP_CustomerSatisfaction# NLP Customer Satisfaction

## Project Overview
The `NLP_CustomerSatisfaction` project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze customer sentiments from reviews. This project aims to predict customer satisfaction levels effectively using machine learning techniques.

## Techniques Used
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Includes tokenization, vectorization, and other preprocessing methods to prepare text data for analysis.
- **Naïve Bayes Classifier**: A probabilistic model used for binary classification of text data.
- **Logistic Regression Classifier**: A statistical model that predicts binary outcomes based on logistic function.
